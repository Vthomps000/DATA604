    "A random seed is a number or vector that initializes a pseudorandom number generator. A pseudorandom number generator's number sequence is determined completely by the seed. Because of the nature of number generating algorithms, so long as the original seed is ignored, the rest of the values generated by the algorithm will follow pseudorandom probability distribution \n",
    "Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by pseudo‐random sampling from known probability distributions. They are an invaluable tool in statistical research that evaluate new methods and compare alternative methods. A key strength of simulation is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods since some truth from parameters of interest is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, like bias. Proper understanding of simulation studies enable statisticians to both run and critically appraise published simulation studies, and conduct simulation studies with greater care and report with transparency. \n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation is statistical techniques that use pseudo‐random sampling. In the article this week, rules of allocation and planning factors for Army air ambulance companies were evaluated quantitatively using the Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically, rules that influence air ambulance units during major combat operations (MCO). The study was to improve the Army’s Total Army Analysis (TAA) process by using better rules of allocation generated by simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to estimate a workload-based rule of allocation during a TAA MCO. "

    "The code snippet above, from last week (https://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy/blob/master/notebooks/chap03.ipynb), was particularly rewarding for me. We were asked to write a modified version of step that checks whetherolin_empty and wellesley_empty are 0. If not, it should set t_first_empty to clock (but only if t_first_empty has not already been set). The exercise clarified how systems are decomposed. It provided a different perspective on decomposing a system into multiple parts that can make problem solving more efficient."
