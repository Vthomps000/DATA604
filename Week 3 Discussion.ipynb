    "1. Verification and validation is an iterative process that takes place throughout the development of a model. They are conducted  to produce an accurate and credible model. In simulation, verification of a model is the process of confirming it is correctly implemented with respect to the conceptual model. Various techniques are used to assure the model matches specifications and assumptions of the conceptual model. Validation checks the accuracy of the model's representation of the real system. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The authors of the journal addressed verification and validation. The article included a model code that provides transparency and verification of the model itself. The results of the simulation do fall into the accepted margin of error. The simulation run estimates indicate the model is behaving as the specifications intended. For validation, the authors did base parameter values on data collected from Operation Iraqi Freedom."
